The `auro-formvalidation` is a JavaScript utility that handles element validation. The purpose of having a separate validation utility is to ensure consistent validation workflow and results across all form element.

The AuroDesignSystem validation workflow closely mirrors the [HTML5 form elements validation workflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation).
