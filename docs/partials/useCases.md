Validation allows for setting the following optional requirements on a form element. These options can be used individually or in any combination.

- `required`: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
- `minlength` and `maxlength`: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).
- `min` and `max`: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.
- `type`: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.
- `pattern`: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.
- `error`: Forces the validation state to be _invalid_ and defines the custom validation message to display.
